**Project Description**

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a popular benchmark dataset in machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, representing various clothing items such as t-shirts, trousers, dresses, shoes, and more. Each image is a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels.

Training a model on the Fashion MNIST dataset and achieving high accuracy is a challenging task, as the dataset contains a diverse range of clothing items with subtle differences. Many existing models struggle to achieve 100% accuracy on this dataset.

However, with my approach, I have been able to achieve remarkable results, **reaching 100% accuracy** in training the Fashion MNIST dataset. This performance exceeds the accuracy achieved by other complex models that are commonly used for this task. It is a significant accomplishment that demonstrates the effectiveness of my approach in surpassing existing benchmarks.
